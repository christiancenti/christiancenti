## 👋 Hi, I'm Christian

**AI Product Engineer based in Milan**, focused on turning real business problems into AI-first, end-to-end digital products.  

I work across the whole lifecycle: from understanding the problem and designing the solution, to shipping production-ready applications that create measurable value.  

My experience ranges from SaaS platforms and workflow automation to data-driven tools that integrate Machine Learning into everyday business processes.  

> The future belongs to those who can design, not just execute – and to those who can lead, not just follow.
